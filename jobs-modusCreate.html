Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p><h2>The Less Quick Version</h2><p> Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. <br> Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. <br> Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.
